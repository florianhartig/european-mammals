# european-mammals
code and instruction how to extract occurence data from http://www.european-mammals.org/ svg-maps, export them as tables and plot them in new, modifyable R-graphics.

## Idea
The basic motivation for this R-Code was the fact that www.european-mammals.org offers maps of the ocurrence of all kind of mammals which exist in Europe and that it would be somehow nice to work with these data in a simple manner.
